# APIMS : API Hit Monitoring System

A multi-tenant platform that any backend service can report its API traffic to. A downstream service drops in a small middleware, every request it serves gets reported asynchronously, and APIMS turns that stream into per-client analytics: hit counts, error rates, latency, and top endpoints - without the downstream service ever blocking on the report.

This repository contains two independent applications:

## Why this exists

Most small services don't have an observability story until something breaks in production. APIMS is a lightweight, self-hosted alternative to wiring every service into a heavyweight observability stack: integrate a single middleware, and get a dashboard of traffic patterns and failure rates per client, per service, per endpoint.

## Quick start

The fastest way to see the whole system working end to end:

1. Start the platform's infrastructure and app containers: see `Running with Docker` inside the [server/README.md](./server/README.md) walkthrough.
2. Onboard a super admin, then a client and an API key, against the running server.
3. Configure and run the demo blog API with that API key: see [demo/blog_api/README.md](./demo/blog_api/README.md).
4. Run the blog API's load-test script to generate sample traffic, then query `GET /api/analytics/dashboard` on the server to see it reflected.

## Tech stack at a glance

The server is built on `Express 5` and `TypeScript`, with `MongoDB` for raw event storage, `PostgreSQL` for aggregated metrics, and `RabbitMQ (via amqplib)` for decoupling ingestion from persistence. Authentication uses `JWT` and `bcrypt`; validation uses `Zod`; structured logging uses `Winston`. The demo blog API is a minimal Express service with no database of its own, included purely to exercise the monitoring pipeline with realistic traffic.
